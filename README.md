# Hello-World
First project in GitHub

Hello GitHub community,

I have a dream of creating a program that enables its user to safely and successfully improve their life through the psychotherapuetic model known as IFS (Internal Family Systems). The purpose of this program would be to utilize proven self-therapy treatment methods to help its user navigate the terrain of their psychological parts in order to heal and integrate them through the power of one's Self.
